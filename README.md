Naïve Bayes:
Naïve Bayes is a family of probabilistic algorithms based on Bayes' theorem, used primarily for classification tasks. It assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class label, which simplifies the computation of probabilities. Despite this assumption being a simplification (hence "naïve"), Naïve Bayes performs surprisingly well in many practical applications, especially in text classification and spam detection. It is efficient, easy to implement, and works well with large datasets.

This dataset includes various demographic and employment attributes, such as age, workclass, education, and occupation, with the target variable being income (indicating whether an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold). By applying Naïve Bayes, we aim to classify individuals into income brackets based on their attributes. The findings can provide insights into income distribution patterns and help identify factors that influence earning potential in different demographic groups.
